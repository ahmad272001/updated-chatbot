      "content": "A 3D backlit sign is a fantastic choice for creating a striking visual impact! These signs typically feature raised letters or graphics that are illuminated from behind, giving them a vibrant and eye-catching appearance, especially at night. \n\nThey can be made from various materials, such as acrylic or metal, and can be customized in terms of size, color, and design. The backlighting can enhance the depth and dimension of the sign, making it stand out even more.\n\nIf you're considering a 3D backlit sign for your project, I can help you with a quote and create a mockup! Would you like to proceed with that? If so, I'll need to collect some specific details from you."
