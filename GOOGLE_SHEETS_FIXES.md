# Google Sheets Integration Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve two critical issues with the Google Sheets integration:

1. **Chat History Update Issue**: Only the first 5-7 messages were being stored, after which only the message count increased
2. **Logo URL Missing**: Uploaded logo URLs were not being added to Google Sheets

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chat History Not Updating Properly

**Problem**: The Google Sheets integration was overwriting the entire conversation column instead of appending new messages, resulting in only the latest message being visible.

**Root Cause**: The `save_session_to_sheets` function was using `worksheet.update()` to replace the entire row, which overwrote the existing conversation.

**Solution**: Modified the update logic to:
- Read the existing conversation from Google Sheets
- Append only new messages to the existing conversation
- Preserve the full conversation history
- Add a clear separator between old and new messages

### 2. Logo URLs Not Added to Google Sheets

**Problem**: When users uploaded logo files, the Dropbox URLs were stored in session data but never added to Google Sheets.

**Root Cause**: The logo URLs were only stored in the session memory and not included in the Google Sheets update process.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `save_session_to_sheets` function to:
- Automatically include logo URLs in the conversation text
- Add a dedicated "LOGO FILES" section to the conversation
- Ensure logo URLs are preserved when updating existing sessions

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Functions

#### 1. `save_session_to_sheets()` in `app.py`

**Changes Made**:
- Added logo URL extraction from session data
- Enhanced conversation formatting to include logo URLs
- Modified update logic to append new messages instead of overwriting
- Added conversation preservation for existing sessions

**Key Code Changes**:
```python
# Get logo URLs from session data and add to conversation
logo_urls = []
if session_id in chat_sessions and "logos" in chat_sessions[session_id]:
    for logo in chat_sessions[session_id]["logos"]:
        if "dropbox_url" in logo:
            logo_urls.append(logo["dropbox_url"])

# Add logo URLs to conversation if available
if logo_urls:
    conversation_text += "\n\n--- LOGO FILES ---\n"
    for i, url in enumerate(logo_urls, 1):
        conversation_text += f"Logo {i}: {url}\n"
```

#### 2. Chat History Update Logic

**Enhanced Update Process**:
```python
# Get existing conversation and append new messages
existing_conversation = ""
if len(row_data) > 4:  # Make sure conversation column exists
    existing_conversation = row_data[4] if row_data[4] else ""

# Append new messages to existing conversation
updated_conversation = existing_conversation
if existing_conversation:
    updated_conversation += "\n\n--- New Messages ---\n"

# Add only the new messages (messages after the existing count)
existing_count = int(row_data[3]) if len(row_data) > 3 and row_data[3].isdigit() else 0
new_messages = chat_history[existing_count:]
```

#### 3. `/save-quote` Endpoint Enhancement

**Changes Made**:
- Simplified logo URL handling by leveraging the enhanced `save_session_to_sheets` function
- Ensured Google Sheets is updated with latest session data when quotes are saved

## Data Flow

### Before Fix
```
User Message â†’ Chat History â†’ Google Sheets (Overwrite) â†’ Lost Previous Messages
Logo Upload â†’ Session Storage â†’ Not Added to Google Sheets
```

### After Fix
```
User Message â†’ Chat History â†’ Google Sheets (Append) â†’ Preserved Full History
Logo Upload â†’ Session Storage â†’ Auto-Included in Google Sheets
```

## Google Sheets Structure

The Google Sheets now contains:

| Column | Content | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| A | Session ID | Unique session identifier |
| B | Email | Customer email address |
| C | Timestamp | Last update timestamp |
| D | Message Count | Total number of messages |
| E | Full Conversation | Complete chat history + Logo URLs |
| F | Status | Session status (active/completed) |

### Conversation Column Format
```
ðŸ‘¤ User: Hi, I need help with a sign
ðŸ¤– Assistant: Hello! I'd be happy to help you with your sign needs. First, could you please provide your email address so I can save your information and follow up with you?

--- New Messages ---

ðŸ‘¤ User: I want a 3D metal sign
ðŸ¤– Assistant: Great choice! 3D metal signs are excellent for durability and professional appearance.

--- LOGO FILES ---
