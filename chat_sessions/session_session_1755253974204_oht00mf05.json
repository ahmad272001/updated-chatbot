To help you get a quote and create a mockup for your sign, I just need a few more details. \n\nI see you mentioned a \"2 by 4 metal sign.\" That's great! Now, could you please provide the following information:\n\n1. Illumination (would you like it with or without lighting?)\n2. Installation surface (e.g., brick wall, concrete, etc.)\n3. Your city and state\n4. Budget range\n5. Placement (indoor or outdoor)\n6. Any deadlines you have in mind (standard is 15-17 business days, or rush is 12 days with a 25% additional cost)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can proceed with your quote and mockup!"
